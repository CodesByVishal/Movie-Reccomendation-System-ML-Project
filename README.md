## Abstract

Netflix, a corporation offering a vast library of TV series and films for online viewing, operates on a subscription model. Retaining customers and keeping them engaged is crucial for its profitability. Recommendation systems play a pivotal role in achieving this goal by providing personalized suggestions to users.

---

## Introduction

Netflix's recommendation system is integral to its success, enhancing user satisfaction, loyalty, and sales. With over 139 million paid customers worldwide and a plethora of titles, understanding user preferences is paramount. This project delves into the mechanisms behind Netflix's recommender system, employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) and K-Means Clustering to enhance content personalization.

---

## Objective

The objective of this project is to explore recommender systems, specifically focusing on Netflix's methodology. By leveraging NLP and clustering techniques, the aim is to develop a model capable of providing personalized recommendations based on textual features such as storyline descriptions and genres.

---

## Data Description

The dataset comprises 7787 rows and 12 columns, including information such as show ID, type (TV show or movie), title, director, cast, country, date added, release year, rating, duration, listed genre, and description. This diverse dataset serves as the foundation for analyzing Netflix content and building a robust recommendation model.
